# Returning to Altitude: Forecasting the Indian Aviation Industry's Growth Trajectory
## Project Overview
This project analyzes the **long-term growth trajectory** of the Indian aviation industry, discounting the disruptions caused by **COVID-19**. By leveraging time series forecasting models, the aim was to understand recovery patterns and assess whether the sector is regaining pre-pandemic momentum.

## Objective
To model and forecast key aviation metrics post-COVID using advanced time series techniques, and evaluate how closely aviation growth is aligning with India's macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP).

## Repository Structure
- **data**: Processed datasets
- **codes**: Python and R files for EDA & modeling
- **graphs**: Forecast plots, visualizations, and comparative graphs
- **output**: Final presentation and a project report of the same
  
## Key Features
- Focused on various variables of the Indian Aviation Sector like **Passenger Movement** and **Aircraft Movement** data.
- Used **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, and **Facebook Prophet** for robust forecasting.
- Accounted for pandemic-induced volatility in the data and modeled long-term trends.
- Assessed recovery by comparing projections against actual post-COVID performance.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Python**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Time Series Models**: ARIMA, SARIMA, Facebook Prophet
- **Jupyter Notebook** for writing codes
- **Excel** for preliminary analysis and visualization

## Insights
- Strong signals of recovery were observed post-2021, especially in passenger traffic.
- Forecasted growth trajectory is positively correlated with India's GDP trends.
- Indian aviation is on track to return to pre-COVID growth levels and beyond.
